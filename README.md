# To Do List

Three weeks into the program, and I'm learning a lot. While I'm growing these skills, I'm also trying to grow my skills as a strategist. To put it plain and simple, I've never been good at planning things out. I have always lacked the patience to do these kinds of approaches, but I am trying to change this. I created a diagram for myself to follow throughout the process. While I didn't actively use it during the execution of this app, it was a great way for me to set my mind to the task and know the steps to take. 

While my css is kind of an ugly duckling, it was really fun to use it, especially with the prebuilt bootstrap features. I'm no Van Gogh, but knowing what bootstrap can do now, I think I can be more intentional in how I craft my JS code to utilize it better. 

In the future, I don't think I want to be so reliant on tables for these kinds of programs. I struggled combining the boot strap elements with appending rows of tables, and I was unsuccessful in getting the appended delete and complete buttons to have stylized elements. I feel like I might have a bit more success trying to work with listed items in the future, and it would give me an opprotunity to try some new things.
